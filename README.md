# What is expected out of this assignment?

This assignment will help you revisit all the concept we have covered so far in the sessions.
The outcome should be - You are confident that you can explain the Drupal core concepts using the implementations you've done so far to anybody. You are well versed with VCS (version control system) flow & usage. You are able to identify what to do in terms of drupal when a problem statement is given.

PLEASE NOTE - You can provide the solution as you consider the best. For ex. Some issues / tasks may not directly indicate what to implement, you will have to figure that out by understanding the problem statement and then implement a solution.

# How to get started?

- Navigate to the "Issues" tab of this github repository to see all the issues that needs to be covered.
- You can use your already created Drupal website (which you have created for previous assignments) or create a new one as per your convenience.
- If in case you are using your already created website - Then you will have to commit & push the code to your already existing drupal git repository
- If in case you are creating a new website - The commit the code of your drupal repository first and then commit the issues you cover.
- The commit message should be as follows - "ISSUE-<id>: <short-description-of-what-is-done-in-commit>" ex. "ISSUE-1: Added the custom module."
- Please use the axelerant drupal code quality checker to make sure that all coding standards are being followed. - https://github.com/axelerant/drupal-quality-checker

  
# How to submit -
  
- Once done with all the issues, please provide me the access to your github reprository for review. My github id - panshulunimity
- Also update your project reprository's README.md file with a small explanation of the implementation done.

Ex.-
## ISSUE - 1 <Added Custom Mdule>
I've added the custom module because that is what the optimal solution is in this case.
## ISSUE - 2 <Added Custom Block>
I've added the custom module because that is what the optimal solution is in this case
